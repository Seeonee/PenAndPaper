Its max HP is equal to the spiritual damage you took, its speed is equal to yours, and it cannot regain HP. If you have an existing fetch, dismiss it.\n\nWhenever you move, your fetch may move as well.\n\nWhenever you attack an enemy character near your fetch, your fetch may then make an attack against that character. Roll a die. On a 5 or higher, the fetch deals spiritual damage equal to its current HP to that character, then evaporates.\n"}
